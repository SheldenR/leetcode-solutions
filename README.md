# Repository Description
This is basically just a repository to document my leetcode progress. I have *no* idea what I'm doing so my code will probably start off shit but this is just to see where this goes :)

Planning to solve all problems using **Python3**.

Drawings made using Microsoft Whiteboard. Quite cool if you haven't used it before.

# Current Study Plan
Working through neetcode roadmap. Swapped on [4/5/2025]. Initially started w/ leetcode 75 but swapped after realizing need the need for learning algorithm by algorithm. 

# Review List
- 933 (Bad solution)
- 844 (Solution memory complexity could be improved)
- 206 (Learn how to iterarively reverse a linked-list) 
- 104 (Make sure you can confidently reimplement this)

# Milestones

- Starting officially [3/19/2025]

- First Medium Solved [3/20/2025] (151)

- Solved 30 Problems [4/4/2025]
