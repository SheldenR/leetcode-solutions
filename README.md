# Repository Description
This is basically just a repository to store all of my leetcode solutions. I have no idea what I'm doing so my code will probably start off shit but this is just to see where this goes :)

Planning to solve all problems using Python3

Drawings made using Microsoft Whiteboard. Quite cool if you haven't used it before.
