# Repository Description
This is basically just a repository to document my leetcode progress. I have *no* idea what I'm doing so my code will probably start off shit but this is just to see where this goes :)

Planning to solve all problems using **Python3**.

Drawings made using Microsoft Whiteboard. Quite cool if you haven't used it before.

# Milestones

- Starting officially [3/19/2025]

- First Medium Solved [3/20/2025] (151)
