# Repository Description
This is basically just a repository to document my leetcode progress. I have *no* idea what I'm doing so my code will probably start off shit but this is just to see where this goes :)

Planning to solve all problems using **Python3**.

Drawings made using Microsoft Whiteboard. Quite cool if you haven't used it before.

# Current Study Plan
Going through all of leetcode 75 as a start, with the addition of some other problems I feel like doing for fun.

# Review List
- 724 (Bad solution)

# Milestones
